% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated

% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.

%%%% MOTIVATION AND ALGORITHM SECTION %%%%
\section{Motivation for the LMS Decoding Algorithm}

ANTONIO:
Feel free to write whatever you want here. Essentially, this section will probably be the same as the second slide in our presentation.
Probably also copy some of the text from the motivation section of the project proposal.
Also, feel free to change the title.


%%%% COMPARISON OF OTHER DECODERS SECTION %%%%
\section{Comparison to other MIMO Decoding Algorithms}

ANTONIO:
Compare the MATLAB simulations. Figure \ref{ser_snr_different_schemes_static} is for a static purely random channel. Figure \ref{ser_snr_different_schemes_dynamic} is based on IEEE model B and has 3Hz doppler.

\subsection{Evaluation of Bitwidths}

Explain why poor performance at low bitwidth (overflow, causing wraparound). Would be better if saturated. Could also use pseudo-floating point.

\section{Synthesis Results}

Clock, area power
Power breakdown
Can achieve better results if voltage scale.

ANTONIO: if you can, please insert some 2x2 vs 4x4 results here. Mention that 4x4 hardware supports 2x2, but more efficient to generate 2x2 hardware.

ANTONIO: do we want to compare to area/power of other MIMO decoders from the literature?

\begin{figure}[!h]

\includegraphics*[width=8cm, viewport = 60 250 560 540]{images/power_vs_area.pdf}
\caption{Power vs area for different levels of parallelism}
\label{power_vs_area}
\end{figure}

Conclusion: better performance if faster clock and take many cycles in MAtrix Engine.

Power gating will clearly help, as shown in table below.

\section{Conclusions and Future Work}

ANTONIO: I'll leave this for you to fill out once you've finished your section.

Things to mention: power gating of initialization modules; adjusting mu (LMS step size) dynamically; producing soft decisions and then adjusting weights based on hard decisions from LDPC decoder; voltage scaling as we reduce the clock rate for higher levels of parallelization; pseudo-floating point or saturating arithmetic in inverse engine to allow fewer bits to be used.
